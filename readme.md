## Explanation

For the resolution of the app I decided to create a command that will process the json and save the necesary content into the database.

I took in consideration the following reason to use this method:

- Processing all the JSON in every request will take more time and resources, this can be more notable when the JSON has a lot of content.

- With the data in the database gives more advantages like filtering, sort and manipulate.

- Using the command we have more benefits for the flexibility to modify an implement more features.

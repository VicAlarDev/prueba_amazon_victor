## Explanation

I chose to implement a command for processing the JSON data and storing the relevant content in the database.  This decision was based on several key reasons:

- Processing all the JSON in each request will take more time and resources, this can be more notable when the JSON has a lot of content.

- Having the data in a database enables efficient filtering, sorting, and other data manipulation operations.

- Utilizing a command offers greater flexibility for future modifications and feature enhancements.
